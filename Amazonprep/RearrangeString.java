/*Given a string, construct a new string by rearranging the original string and deleting characters as needed.
 *  Return the alphabetically largest string that can be constructed respecting a limit as to how many 
 *  consecutive characters can be the same.

Example:
s='bacc'
k=2

The largest string, alphabetically, is 'cccba' but it is not allowed because it uses the character 
'c' more than 2 times consecutively. Therefore, the answer is 'ccbca'.

getLargestString has the following parameters:
string s[n]: the original string
int k: the maximum number of identical consecutive characters the new string can have

Returns:
